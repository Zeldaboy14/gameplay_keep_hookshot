This is for using hookshot/longshot for both ages. In a normal scenario, you can only use it either as child or adult. I've added the
necessary stuff to gameplay_keep so it can be used between both! If not using a manifest, refer to documentation on Arms_Hook.zovl 
and the Code code file, then enter the bytes given. 1.0 version by Majora of Time.

Special thanks to Noka, CDI-Fails, z64.me, and Crooked Poe on advice for this!

And a thanks to Majora of Time for making a 1.0 version!
